		      <h4>Task 5: Ways to Decode Copyrighted Videos</h4>
		      <p>- When you have a DVD inside of your computer, you can easily get the contents of the disk and insert it into your hard drive.
						 - To simplify this process, there is a program known as “HandBrake” which encodes the files within the CD and rips it into your computer as one movie file.
						 - You first open the DVD on “HandBrake,” Choose a quality Preset, and finally process the file to rip the contents.
						 - This is a more efficient and useful tactic to saving old movies that are on CD’s into a raw file to save onto a computer or archive into an external hard drive.

		      <h4>Task 6: Polynesi.scr File Decoding</h4>
		      <p>After decoding the file, we were able to
Find the key to unlock the hidden Disney photos within the file.
Using a “Hex Editor” we were able crack the binary digits of the file to open it.
From our previous trial and error procedures to crack the file, we managed to retrieve the key similar to how we found it by analyzing the file visually.
This eliminated the need to go through the file to find the password string.

					<h4>Task 7: Ways to Archive Online Videos</h4>
		      <p>Archiving videos online is a simple process of searching up a YouTube downloader.
First, select/click on the video you would like to save onto your hard drive.
Next, copy the URL of the video you would like to salvage and paste it into the website “keepvid.com”
After the website generates the video to become downloadable, pick the format you want the video in (preferably “MP4”) and click download.
Once the download completes, you have an official, movie file copy of a YouTube video.
